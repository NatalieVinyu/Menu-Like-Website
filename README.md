# What I learned
I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML by grouping the items into their correct category. I made use of using headings, paragraphs and div element. For CSS I applied color that goes along with my menu and images. I made use of spacing, borders and fonts that will make my menu visually appealing. I also learnt how to make use of classes and IDs to target specific elements and make styling easier. I used transitions on the images to make my webpage more exciting. I then made my webpage responsive so it can be viewed properly on smaller screens.
